# Evo

A programming language made for being the DNA of genetic algorithms.

Raw results from the decade-old project: https://s3.amazonaws.com/superjoe/temp/fix_quirks/out.html

I never did a blog writeup for this, so I'm rebooting it in Zig.

## Status

 * [x] Experiment with using Brainfuck code as the DNA of a genetic algorithm,
       as a control group.
 * [ ] Invent Evo language and implement an interpreter.
 * [ ] Test to find out how effective it is.

## Building and Running

```
zig build
./zig-cache/bin/evo
```
